# sorting-algorithms-visualized

This package is a collection of some sorting algortithms (currently BubbleSort, QuickSort and InsertionSort) including a visualization to help understand how they work. Sorting-algorithms-visualized is written in Java using the Processing Library.

#### Based on *Processing*

Warning: This package is based on the open-source project [*Processing*](https://github.com/processing/processing/) and is currently designed to work with ver3.2.3.
Please download the Processing Development Environment (PDE) [here](processing.org)

#### Easy extendability

This package includes an [abstract class](https://github.com/timgrohmann/sorting-algorithms-visualized/blob/master/sortingalg.pde) you can extend yourself to implement new algorithms. If you feel like adding some, please go ahead and open a pull request to share your code with the rest of us.

#### Generic

This package uses Java's Generics so it basically works with any class implementing the `Comparable<T>` protocol.
